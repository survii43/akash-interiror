# Enhanced Project Schema - Implementation Summary

## Executive Overview

The Akash App has been enhanced with a **comprehensive project management schema** that supports complex project measurement, deduction tracking, work rate management, team collaboration, and complete audit trails. This enhancement allows the application to scale from basic client-project management to enterprise-grade construction project accounting and verification.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Complete Data Models (DELIVERED)

#### 1. **Enhanced Project Model** 
```dart
File: lib/models/project_model.dart
Fields Added:
- location: Project location (e.g., "State Street, Chennai")
- createdBy: User who created the project
- totalAreaSqm: Total measured area in square meters
- totalDeductionSqm: Total deductions in square meters
- totalClaimableSqm: Claimable area after deductions
- totalClaimableSqft: Claimable area in square feet
- verifiedBy: User who verified measurements
- verifiedOn: Timestamp of verification
- Status options: tender | active | completed | on-hold | cancelled

Integration: Maintains existing Client (1:N) relationship
```

#### 2. **Work Item Model**
```dart
File: lib/models/work_item_model.dart
Purpose: Track individual measurements/work items
Features:
- Serial numbering (sNo) for item ordering
- Dimensional data: lengthM, widthM, quantityCount
- Calculated areas: areaSqm, areaSqft
- Work categorization: wall, floor, ceiling, door, window, finishing, other
- Material tracking: materialType
- Image references: imageRef for documentation
- On-site remarks for notes

Validation:
- Area calculations: areaSqm = lengthM × widthM × quantityCount
- Unit measures: Meter | sqft | sqm | Count | Liter | kg
```

#### 3. **Deduction Model**
```dart
File: lib/models/deduction_model.dart
Purpose: Track deductions from work items (openings, obstacles, etc.)
Features:
- Linked to WorkItem for traceability
- Reason categorization: Window opening | Door opening | Pipe | Electrical outlet | Damage | Other
- Dimensional data: lengthM, widthM, quantity
- Calculated areas: areaSqm, areaSqft
- Full audit trail with timestamps

Validation:
- Total deductions cannot exceed 100% of work item area
- Area calculation verification
```

#### 4. **Work Rate Model**
```dart
File: lib/models/work_rate_model.dart
Purpose: Manage rates for different work categories with time-based validity
Features:
- Category-based rates: Different rates for walls, floors, etc.
- Unit flexibility: sqft | sqm | meter | count
- Rate validity period: effectiveFrom → effectiveTo
- Currency support: INR | USD | EUR | GBP
- Time-based queries: isEffective(DateTime) method

Use Case: Calculate project value = totalClaimableSqm × effective_rate
```

#### 5. **Project User Model**
```dart
File: lib/models/project_user_model.dart
Purpose: Manage team members with role-based access and permissions
Features:
- Role-based access: designer | engineer | supervisor | accountant | admin | viewer
- RACI Matrix support: R (Responsible) | A (Accountable) | C (Consulted) | I (Informed)
- Granular permissions:
  ✓ canEditMeasurements
  ✓ canApproveDeductions
  ✓ canViewTenders
  ✓ canAddRates
  ✓ canDeleteItems
  ✓ canApproveProject
- Active status tracking: assignedAt, removedAt

Permission Matrix:
┌─────────────┬──────┬──────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Role        │ Edit │ Appr │ Tender │ Rates  │ Delete │ Final  │
├─────────────┼──────┼──────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
│ Admin       │ ✅   │ ✅   │ ✅     │ ✅     │ ✅     │ ✅     │
│ Supervisor  │ ✅   │ ✅   │ ✅     │ ❌     │ ❌     │ ❌     │
│ Engineer    │ ✅   │ ❌   │ ❌     │ ✅     │ ❌     │ ❌     │
│ Designer    │ ❌   │ ❌   │ ✅     │ ❌     │ ❌     │ ❌     │
│ Accountant  │ ❌   │ ❌   │ ✅     │ ✅     │ ❌     │ ❌     │
│ Viewer      │ ❌   │ ❌   │ ✅     │ ❌     │ ❌     │ ❌     │
└─────────────┴──────┴──────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

#### 6. **Accountability Log Model**
```dart
File: lib/models/accountability_log_model.dart
Purpose: Complete audit trail of all actions and changes
Features:
- Action tracking: Pre-defined actions (17 common actions supported)
- User attribution: performedBy (user ID/name)
- Change tracking: changedFields, oldValues, newValues (JSON strings)
- Comments: Support for explanatory notes
- Item tracking: Links to specific workItemId

Common Actions:
- Approved deduction, Rejected deduction
- Added/Updated/Deleted work item
- Added/Updated/Deleted deduction
- Added/Updated/Deleted rate
- Status changed, User added/removed
- Verified measurements
```

## Database Schema

### Relationships
```
Clients (1) ──→ (N) Projects
Projects (1) ──→ (N) WorkItems
Projects (1) ──→ (N) Deductions
WorkItems (1) ──→ (N) Deductions
Projects (1) ──→ (N) WorkRates
Projects (1) ──→ (N) ProjectUsers
Projects (1) ──→ (N) AccountabilityLogs
WorkItems (1) ──→ (N) AccountabilityLogs (optional)
```

### Tables to Create
1. `work_items` - Measurement tracking
2. `deductions` - Opening and obstacle tracking
3. `work_rates` - Rate management with time validity
4. `project_users` - Team management with permissions
5. `accountability_logs` - Audit trail

### Recommended Indexes (from PROJECT_SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md)
- `idx_projects_clientId`, `idx_projects_status`, `idx_projects_location`
- `idx_workitems_projectId`, `idx_workitems_category`, `idx_workitems_sNo`
- `idx_deductions_projectId`, `idx_deductions_workItemId`
- `idx_workrates_projectId`, `idx_workrates_category`, `idx_workrates_effective`
- `idx_projectusers_projectId`, `idx_projectusers_email`, `idx_projectusers_active`
- `idx_accountlogs_projectId`, `idx_accountlogs_action`, `idx_accountlogs_timestamp`

## Calculation Engine

### Area Conversions
```
1 sqm = 10.764 sqft
1 sqft = 0.092903 sqm
```

### Project Summary Calculation
```dart
totalAreaSqm = SUM(work_items.areaSqm)
totalDeductionSqm = SUM(deductions.areaSqm)
totalClaimableSqm = totalAreaSqm - totalDeductionSqm
totalClaimableSqft = totalClaimableSqm × 10.764
```

### Financial Valuation
```dart
projectValue = totalClaimableSqm × effective_work_rate
```

- ✅ Change tracking with old/new values
- ✅ User attribution for all actions
- ✅ Compliance-ready design
- ✅ Multi-currency support
- ✅ Team collaboration features

## Summary

The enhanced project schema transforms the Akash App from a simple client-project manager into an **enterprise-grade project measurement and accounting system**. With 6 comprehensive new models, detailed documentation, and clear implementation guidance, the foundation is set for scaling to support complex construction projects with multiple work items, deductions, rates, team members, and complete audit trails.

**All Phase 1 deliverables are complete. Ready for Phase 2 database service implementation.**
